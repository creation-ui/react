## Instaling PRO packages

Using npm via terminal

> npm login --registry https://r.privjs.com

> npm i -S react-gradient-progress --registry https://r.privjs.com

Using CI/CD environments such as Netlify, Zeit, Travis CI, etc.
Add `.npmrc` file to your project root with the following line:

```bash copy
 //r.privjs.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

Set environment variable NPM_TOKEN with your PrivJs Token in your preferred CI/CD environment
That's all
