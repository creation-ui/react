# TextArea

The TextArea component provides a multi-line text input field, allowing users to input larger volumes of text. It supports various customizable features, such as different sizes, loading states, error states, and more, enabling it to adapt to different usage scenarios within your application.

<TextAreaPlayground />

It's important to note that the TextArea component's width won't adjust dynamically like [Input](/docs/components/input) because it has `resize` class and can be manually resized by dragging the bottom-right corner.
If you prefer a fixed width or [different resize behaviour](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/resize), you can set this by providing custom width constraints, either through a wrapper component or by passing a class to the `className` prop.
For example:

```tsx copy
// example with tailwindcss custom width
<TextArea className='w-[200px] resize-y' />
```

## Component API

The TextArea component has several props available for customization, outlined in the props table below. In addition, it accepts all native props that are applicable to the HTML TextArea element:

<PropsTable
  properties={properties}
  name='TextArea'
  description={
    <>
      The rest of the props are the same as for the native <code>textarea</code>{' '}
      component.
    </>
  }
/>
