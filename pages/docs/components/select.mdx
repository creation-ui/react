The Select component allows users to choose one or more options from a list. It is perfect for scenarios where a user is presented with multiple choices. This user-friendly and highly customizable component is versatile and can be used in a myriad of applications, from simple forms to complex interactive designs. Try out the examples below to see it in action!

## Selecting multiple options

The multiple prop enhances the Select component's functionality, enabling the selection of multiple options simultaneously. This is especially useful when there is a need to provide an option for multi-choice answers or preferences.

When the multiple prop is active, the `value` and `onChange` props adjust their signature as follows:

| Property | `!multiple` | `multiple`    |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| value    | `T`         | `T[]`         |
| onChange | `T => void` | `T[] => void` |
