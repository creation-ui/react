# Autocomplete

The Autocomplete component dynamically suggests options as users type into an input field. This enhances user experience by making data entry faster and more accurate, particularly when dealing with large data sets. With multiple selection and customization capabilities, it offers high versatility for a wide range of applications.

This component is built upon fantastic [@floating-ui/react](https://floating-ui.com/) library.<br/>

## Autocompleteing multiple options

With the `multiple` prop, the Autocomplete component allows for the selection of multiple options, providing a dynamic and versatile user experience.

<AutocompleteMultiPlayground />

In the `multiple` mode, the `value` and `onChange` props adjust their signature as follows:

| Property | `!multiple` | `multiple`    |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| value    | `T`         | `T[]`         |
| onChange | `T => void` | `T[] => void` |

For more details, please refer to the [properties table.](#onChange)
